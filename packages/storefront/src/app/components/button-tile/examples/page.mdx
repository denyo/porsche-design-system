## UI behaviour

The component is able to break out of its aspect ratio in case content overflows to be accessibility compliant (see
first row in example).

Additionally, the component is able to align to the highest CSS Grid child independent of the aspect ratio when used in
CSS Grid context (see second row in example).

<Notification heading="Browser Support Limitation" heading-tag="h3" state="warning">
  Currently, Safari is only able to align the height per CSS Grid row as long as the content does not overflow.
</Notification>

<ComponentStory story={buttonTileStoryGrid} />
