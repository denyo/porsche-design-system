# Accordion <ComponentStatus tagName="p-accordion"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-accordion` is a component that reveals or hides associated sections of content.
Accordions are flexible in the context and can include other components of the Porsche Design System.

It is a controlled component. This means it does not contain any internal state, and you got full control over its
behavior.

<TableOfContents headings={["Basic Example","Custom clickable/focusable area"]} />

## Basic Example

<ComponentExample codeSample={accordionExample} />

## Custom clickable/focusable area

Sometimes it might be useful to enlarge the clickable/focusable area to fulfill accessibility guidelines. Therefore, a
custom padding can be set on the slotted heading element.
